# LeartS 's dotfiles
These are my dotfiles.

You can use [dotdrop](https://github.com/deadc0de6/dotdrop) to work with them,
or just take a look at the human-friendly [./dotdrop.yaml](./dotdrop.yaml) to see where each file/folder is supposed to go,
and copy/link them manually.

Example dotdrop command (make sure to be in the folder containing the dotdrop.yaml file)

```bash
dotdrop --cfg=dotdrop.yaml --profile regolith install
```
